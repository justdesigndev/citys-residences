Warm all year round, ready all year round.  
Sometimes early in the morning, sometimes in the middle of the day...  
Strokes are made, burdens lighten.

Swimming is not exercise, it's gently separating yourself from the rush of the day...  
Sometimes just one stroke is enough to live.

The mind clears, the world is left behind step by step.
