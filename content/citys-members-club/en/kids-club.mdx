Play is not just entertainment for a child; it's the first path to learning, developing, and discovering the world...

At City's Members Club, in areas designed with special details for two separate age groups on two separate floors, there's not just fun, there's trust, care, and a pedagogically structured learning world.

A comfortable breath for you, a safe and exciting world for them.
