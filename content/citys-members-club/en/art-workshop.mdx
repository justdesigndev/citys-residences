Some think with colors, some tell by touching. We've opened space for these different forms of expression, these unique inner worlds.

This is not just a workshop but a freedom area extending from brush to canvas, from clay to ceramics, from art to dreams...

A privilege where children dream, and adults give voice to their emotions, where they can hear their own inner voices.

Children who dream can change the world... Adults who express themselves live happier. Let life find its own color.
