Shall we add some coolness to the day?

Grab a lounger by the pool, put on your sunglasses, turn on the music...  
Whether you swim, relax, or dive into books...  
At City's Residences, pool enjoyment is lived however you want.

No one rushes anywhere, no one hurries.  
Because this isn't just a pool, it's a breathing space where you feel your freedom in the heart of the city.

Life is sometimes just about breathing.
